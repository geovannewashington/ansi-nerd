# Introduction to Linked List

## Types of Linked List

Single Linked List: Navigation is forward only.
Doubly Linked List: Forward and backward navigation is possible.
Circular Linked List: Last element is linked to the first element.

A single linked list is a list made up of `nodes` that consists of two parts:

1. data
2. link

Note: the last node points to `NULL`
There is also the `HEAD` which is the first node.
