// Pointer arithmetic (also known as address arithmetic) describes the process of moving through your 
// computer's memory by adding or subtracting numbers to go from one memory location to another.

// In C, pointer arithmetic is used all the time under the hood. Even if you never write something like 
// ptr + 1 in C code, pointer arithmetic happens undeer the hood whenever we use arrays or arrays-like structures.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The type the pointer points to is not only important to correctlly dereference it but also for pointer arithmetic
