# Basics of Dynamic Memory Allocation

The processs of allocating memory at the time of execution is called  
`dynamic memory allocation`.

Heap is the segment in memory where dyamic memory allocation takes place.

Unlike stack where memory is allocated or deallocated in a defined order, heap is an area of memory
where memory is allocated or deallocated without any order or randomy.
