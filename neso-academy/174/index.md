# Types of Data Structures

Data structures have many different classifications:

## Linear and Non-linear

1. Linear
   A data structure is said to be linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear (sequential)
   order. Examples include: arrays, queues, stack and linked list. The elements of these structures
   have a single predecessor and sucessor expect the first and last elements.
2. Non-Linear
   A data structure is said to be non-linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear (sequential)
   order. Examples include: trees and graphs.

## Static and Dynamic

1. Static
   A data structure is static when the memory for it is allocated ahead of time during the compilation process.
   Therefore maximum size is fixed.
   Advantage: Fast access
   Disadvantage: Slower insertion and deletion
   Examples includes: a classic array
2. Dynamic
   A data structure is dynamic when the memory for it is allocated at run time, that is, during the execution
   of the program. Therefore the maximum size is flexibe.
   Advantage: Faster insertion and deletion
   Disadvantage: Slower access
   Examples includes: Linked List

NOTE: So there is not such a thing as "The best data structure" it really depends on the case.
