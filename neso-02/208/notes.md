# Traversing the List (Linked List vs. Arrays)

In a linked list, `counting` the amount of nodes, essentially what would be the `length` of an array
AND printing the data takes `O(n)`.

In an array, `counting` the amount of elements takes constant time because we make use of the `sizeof`
operator for this. But printing the elements the the same `O(n)`, time as the linked.

it seems like the only advantage of linked lists over arrays when it comes to time complexity is inserting
elements. (could be wrong).
