# Structures and Functions (Part 2)

Instead of passing individual members of a variable that implements a structure to a function,
it good practice to just pass the whole variable to the function.

Reminder: in C, when we passs a variable that implements a structure, it's done by value, that is,
a local copy of that whole variable (structure) is created within the function.
