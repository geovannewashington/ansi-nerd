Basic of Asymptotic Analysys (part 3)

Measing the actual running time is not pratical at all.
Why? because the actual runing time depends on factors unrelated to the algorithm itself.
Such as: hardware, input variations, operating system and so on...

Note that asymptotic analysys gives a machine-independent measure of efficiency rather than a time
in miliseconds.
